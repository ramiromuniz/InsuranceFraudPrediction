# Vehicle Insurance Fraud Detection
## Overview
This project aims to identify and predict fraudulent activities in vehicle insurance claims. Utilizing machine learning algorithms, we analyze historical insurance claim data to uncover patterns indicative of fraud. The outcome assists insurance companies in enhancing their fraud detection capabilities, leading to saving costs and improving customer trust.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises insurance claim records with features related to policy details, customer demographics, incident specifics, and claim amounts. Notable columns include policy_number, insured_sex, incident_type, collision_type, incident_severity, and fraud_reported.

## Key Steps
**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and encoding of the dataset to prepare it for analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visual and statistical examination of data to understand patterns, detect outliers, and identify significant variables.

**Feature Engineering:** Enhancement of the dataset with new features to improve model accuracy.

**Modeling:** Deployment of machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers, to predict fraudulent claims.

**Evaluation:** Assessment of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimization of model parameters using GridSearchCV for enhanced prediction capability.

## Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
scikit-learn for modeling and evaluation
